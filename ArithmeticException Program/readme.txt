Task:
Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user enters two numbers in the textfields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw a NumberFormatException. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throw an ArithmeticException. Display the exception in a message dialog box.
