ABSTRACT CLASSES & INTERFACE USING SWING UI

You'll Learn: In this program there is an implementation of interface, abstract methods, protected variables, constuctor, super key word, inheritance, Swing UI, ActionListener etc.

Objective:
Write the interface called GeometricObject, which declares two abstract methods: getParameter() and getArea(),
Write the implementation class Circle, with a protected variable radius, which implements the interface GeometricObject.
Write a test program called TestCircle to test the methods defined in Circle. 
The class ResizableCircle is defined as a subclass of the class Circle, which also implements an interface called Resizable. The interface Resizable declares an abstract method resize(), which modifies the dimension (such as radius) by the given percentage. Write the interface Resizable and the class ResizableCircle. Write a test program called TestResizableCircle to test the methods defined in ResizableCircle.
Use JCheckBox, JButton, JTextFeild and appropriate event handlers to handle the event generated by the components used.
