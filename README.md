# Advanced-Object-Oriented-Programming---JAVA
This repository will be the Advanced and most complete for Object Oriented Programming. The repository will serve both beginners and advanced learners to understand advanced concepts of OOP. The programming language for this is still JAVA as my previous Basic OOP concepts repository covers the basics. In this Advanced OOP repository, I'll cover all four pillars Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. With Swing User Interface (checkboxes, buttons, Combobox, fields, textarea, Listbox, jtable, radiobuttons, etc.), Exceptions Handling, Throw Exceptions, Abstract Classes and methods, Method overloading and overriding, Math class, constructors, instances, Java Database Connectivity by Using PreparedStatement, Java Socket Programming both TCP and UDP, also you'll know how to make chat App and way much more!

Points to be noted or the things will be covered in this repository:

1. Here I'll start with How you'll manually only by code can create JFrame Window and other compnents (checkboxes, buttons, Combobox, fields, textarea, Listbox, jtable, radiobuttons, etc.). For this you'll need NetBeans or Eclipse.

2. I'll cover abstraction, interface, inheritance in details and upload all the related Java scripts or programs.

3. Exception Handling, Throw class (for generating your own exceptions within the program) will be covered as well along with Java programs.

4. Polymorphism -- Method overloading and overriding

5. Then I'll move to Swing UI. Where things gets more advanced and you can be able to create UI by just drag and drop. Here with UI apps I'll cover Java Database Connectivity by Using PreparedStatement with all CRUD operations, Java Socket Programming both TCP and UDP by providing code for Chat Apps. 

6. And lot more!
